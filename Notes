We went in and gave the application a permission service that goes in and gives a USER AND ADMIN role. 
We created a Service annotation that let's Spring know it's not in an encapsulated state.
We created a getToken method that goes and retrieves the login information and compares it and returns and authentication.
Added the editUser parameter that gives the users their roles and if they can edit the users
Added the mode.addAttribute Permission to the controller to give the profiles the attributes and the permission service we established
for the users having roles and being able to edit the users. 

How many different roles can we give users?
What other services can we add to websites other than permissionService?

The app has changed relatively little but the functionality definitely has changed and makes it more of a serious application with 
and ADMIN that controls and can edit the user information and not everyone has access to editing the profiles except the ADMIN.
